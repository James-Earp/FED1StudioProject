                                Culinary Arts degree:
                            </dt>
                            <dd style="margin: auto;">
                                This all-around degree can provide students with broad, general knowledge of the culinary arts field. Typically, students get an introduction to the food-service industry, including its history and present environment, as well as an introduction to taste and flavor. Students are likely to learn about time management, study and research skills, technology utilization, and teamwork. Degree seekers might also receive instruction on goal setting, self-branding portfolio, and brand management.

                                Students seeking this type of degree will likely also learn about kitchen essentials, culinary techniques, fundamentals, and nutrition, as well as a la carte dining and the pantry kitchen. Baking and pastry fundamentals might also be taught, as well as meat selection and fabrication.

                                As the student advances into the second year of the program, he or she might learn skills appropriate to management, including dining room organization and procedures, opening and closing, customer care, salesmanship, table setting, table-side cooking and carving, and food service supervision, as well as international cooking and advanced baking and pastry arts.

                                Baking and Pastry Arts diploma:
                            </dt>
                            <dd style="float: initial;">
                                Obviously, with this diploma the student will focus on combining cooking and other skills provided in a program such as the culinary arts, but also will receive the more specific training that the student would need for creating desserts and baked goods. Developing study methods and techniques used in the baking and pastry disciplines would likely be emphasized, as would developing and executing recipes for large and small occasions.

                                Food Service Management degree

                            <dd style="float: right;">
                                A degree in this field is suitable for those who want to do more than just serve great food. Those with a desire to manage and run the whole show should build their business and management skills, in combination with their knowledge of food. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, degrees in Food Service Management give job seekers an edge, since a growing number of manager positions call for postsecondary education in food service or hospitality management programs.

                                Culinary Nutrition degree:
                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                A new kind of culinary professional educated in how to put together appealing but also nutritious meals is in growing demand, as consumers base buying decisions at restaurants and throughout the food service industry on nutrition. An aspirant in this field might obtain an associate's degree in cooking, but with an emphasis on nutrition.
